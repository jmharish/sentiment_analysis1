# sentiment_analysis1
The project is aimed to analyse the sentiment, (positive or negative) behind a statement or a comment 
The project streams live tweets (a small percentage of the real-time tweets ) and filters the tweets containing a particular word and analyses the stream 
and plots a live graph positive/negative sentiment behind the tweets.
The project has 4 .py file of which graph_twitter.py is to be used for the final plotting of the sentiment graph
The other 3 .py file have functions and classifiers that are subsequently used
The twitter_res.txt file saves the values to be plotted on the graph
The .pickle files saves the trained classifiers (done in text_clasiification.py) as training them against the test sets take a lot of time
